                    I am a dedicated software developer who graduated with
                    computer science degree at the University of British
                    Columbia.

                    {/* When I was young, I loved playing with computers whether it
                  was just playing with pre-installed computer games like
                  Pinball or just browsing through internets. As I entered
                  University and got a chance to learn more about computers, I
                  absolutely fell in love with software engineering. I had
                  opportunities to develop in several areas but I found web
                  developing the most entertaining as I was not only able to
                  code but I was also able to design as well. Thus, during my
                  3rd and 4th year, I chose to focus mainly on web-dev projects
                  and worked on several eCommerce websites.
